## Purpose

This Battleship project was part of my self-guided education through The Odin Project JS Curriculum. The intention of this was to practice the basics of testing using Jest, while also refining my skills with JavaScript.

Some of the challenges, aside from learning Jest, included using object-oriented paradigms.
